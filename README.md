-说明：Pro/E生成的wrl含有较多冗余信息，且各个面被拆分到多个Shape中，赋予材质需要逐面操作，十分繁琐。故编写本程序。
-Descript: The .wrl files generated by Pro/Engineer include many redundance Node, and each faces are divided into multi shape Node. Giving the model materials requires to operate face by face, which is too much trouble. So I do.

 精简完成后，所有多余节点及嵌套关系都会消失，并将所有面合并到一个Shape节点上。
 After purging operation, all of the redundance Node and embed relationship will be removed, and all the faces will be merged into one shape Node.
